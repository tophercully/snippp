### 1: Code toolkits -- instead of libraries

There is a sweet spot between memorizing a function and keeping it in a library. Snippp is designed to give you fast access to the snippets you need, without the bloat.

#### Ideals:

- Tools should be accessible to everyone
- One should have as little friction between needing something and finding what they need, like an extension of memory
- Tools saved on Snippp can be anything in the programming umbrella
- With a wide range of programmers sharing toolkits in a variety of areas, Snippp can become a rich educational resource

  <br>
  <br>
Need a function to convert polar to cartesian coordinates? <br>
Have a killer ESLint config you want to share? <br>
Need a bunch of UI components written specifically with Preact signals?
<br>
<br>
This is all what Snippp is built for

### 2: Basics

Snippp has a few main features:

- Dashboard
- Snippet Browser
- Curated Toolkits
- Toolkit Browser (Coming soon!)

The Dashboard is where most users will spend most of their time (ideally only a few seconds) when they need to access a toolkit.
It provides a top-level view of all toolkits, and is navigable with keyboard shortcuts. You can enter a toolkit and look through any snippet inside. Copy, favorite, share, or fork the snippet for yourself.
<br>
<br>
The Snippet Browser is similar, giving you access to all public snippets, filterable by category. Categories can be manually assigned on creation or automatically assigned by a language and framework detection algorithm.
<br>
<br>
Curated Toolkits are currently curated by me (Chris McCully), looking through public toolkits and presenting the most useful, flexible, and quality toolkits on the featured page. My hope is that this incentivizes high effort toolkits here for others to find.
<br>
<br>
The Toolkit Browser opens up all public toolkits to everyone, where this can be a completely open database of published code toolkits useful to programmers looking to find clever tools to solve problems. (in development)

#### If you have improvements you'd like to make, feel free to contribute. Snippp is open-source and free to use. I'm working to set up a dev branch of the database for contributors that syncs with the main branch regularly. Contact me if you'd like the details :)
